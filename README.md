# Full Speed Ahead

Vehicle movement helpers for Foundry VTT.

Full Speed Ahead rotates vehicle tokens toward their movement destination, can sequence rotation before movement, plays movement sound effects, adds configurable thruster trails, and includes a targeting helper for ship combat.

## Features

- Automatically rotates actor tokens with type `vehicle`.
- Smooth shortest-path rotation during the first few grid spaces of movement.
- Configurable rotation update interval, finish distance, and rotation offset for different ship art orientations.
- Movement sound effect with configurable path and volume.
- Under-token PIXI thruster cone rendered in the scene below the ship art with configurable color, length, and width.
- Movement effects settings menu with an audio browse button and thruster color picker.
- Blue vehicle Token HUD gear for opening the Movement Effects menu from the right-click overlay.
- Name-keyed ship profiles for exhaust color overrides shared by every vehicle with the same name.
- Vehicle Sheet Cosmetics panel with an optional Creature Capacity to Module Capacity label change.
- Movement sounds are broadcast once by the movement initiator to avoid doubled playback.
- Token-control targeting button for GMs and players.
